The effects of video games on school achievement
Gwen Dewar
The article on Parenting Science examines how video games can influence academic achievement. It highlights that while video games can enhance cognitive skills such as attention and spatial abilities, excessive gaming may detract from school performance due to time displacement, especially if it interferes with homework and sleep. Research findings vary, with some studies showing minor negative effects and others indicating positive impacts depending on the game type, duration, and individual differences. The article emphasizes moderation and balancing gaming with academic responsibilities.

How Gaming Affects Learning in College
Cam Adair
Excessive gaming can significantly impact college students’ academic performance by reducing study time, lowering GPA, and hindering time-management skills. Gaming addiction is linked to procrastination and disrupted sleep patterns, leading to decreased motivation. Overcoming these habits often involves reducing screen time and incorporating more structure into study routines to improve focus and productivity. For students looking to reduce gaming’s influence, setting clear academic goals and maintaining regular study habits can help reclaim time spent on gaming and enhance learning outcomes. The primary econometric techniques employed include regression analysis to explore the relationship between gaming hours and academic outcomes, and time-series analysis to observe patterns over semesters. Key questions address the extent of gaming's impact on GPA, time management, and learning efficacy.
